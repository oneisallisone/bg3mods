    "q1": {
      "question": "How do I install mods for Baldur's Gate 3?",
      "answer": "Most BG3 mods can be installed using mod managers like Vortex or BG3 Mod Manager. First, download the mod file, then use the manager to install and activate it. Some mods may require manual installation - always read the mod's documentation carefully.",
      "subQuestions": {
        "1": {
          "q": "Which mod manager should I choose?",
          "a": "For beginners, Vortex is recommended as it offers a user-friendly interface and integrates well with Nexus Mods. It features automatic downloads, easy installation, and conflict detection. BG3 Mod Manager (BG3MM) is preferred by advanced users for its powerful features like detailed load order control, mod profiles, and better handling of complex mod configurations. Both are actively maintained and support the latest game version."
        },
        "2": {
          "q": "How do I install mods manually?",
          "a": "Manual installation involves several steps:<br><br>1. Locate your game's mod folder at 'Documents/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods'<br>2.

        },
        "3": {
          "q": "What's the correct load order for mods?",
          "a": "The general rule for mod load order is:<br><br>1. Engine Fixes & Libraries (e.g., Native Mod Loader)<br>2. Script Extenders & Core Mods<br>3. Bug Fixes & Patches<br>4. Gameplay Overhauls<br>5. Class & Race Mods<br>6. Item & Equipment Mods<br>7. Visual & UI Mods<br>8. Compatibility Patches<br><br>Specific mods may have their own load order requirements.

      }
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Are mods compatible with multiplayer?",
      "answer": "Mod compatibility in multiplayer depends on several factors. Generally, all players need to have the same mods installed in the same order. UI and visual mods are usually safer for multiplayer than gameplay-changing mods.",
      "subQuestions": {
        "1": {
          "q": "How do I sync mods with friends?",
          "a": "To ensure proper mod synchronization:<br><br>1. Create a shared mod list document<br>2. Include exact mod versions and download links<br>3. Agree on a specific load order<br>4.

          "q": "Which mods are safe for multiplayer?",
          "a": "Safe mods for multiplayer include:<br><br>• UI Enhancements (inventory sorting, better tooltips)<br>• Visual Improvements (textures, character appearances)<br>• Quality of Life Features (camera adjustments, hotkey changes)<br>• Performance Optimizations<br>• Shader/Graphics Tweaks<br><br>Avoid mods that:<br>• Change core gameplay mechanics<br>• Add new items or abilities<br>• Modify game balance<br>• Change quest or story content"
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "What happens if mod versions don't match?",
          "a": "Mismatched mod versions can cause:<br><br>1. Connection Failures: Game may fail to establish multiplayer connection<br>2. Desyncs: Players experience different game states<br>3. Crashes: Game may become unstable or crash<br>4. Save Corruption: Multiplayer saves might become corrupted<br><br>Always verify that all players have identical mod versions before starting a session.

        },
        "2": {
          "q": "Do all mods disable achievements?",
          "a": "Yes, by default any modification to the game files will disable achievements. This includes:<br><br>• Gameplay Mods<br>• Visual Mods<br>• UI Modifications<br>• Custom Content<br>• Script Changes<br><br>This is a built-in security feature to maintain achievement integrity. Even minor modifications like texture changes will trigger this protection."
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "Are achievement enabler mods safe?",
          "a": "Achievement enabler mods are generally considered safe because:<br><br>1. They don't modify game content or mechanics<br>2. They only affect the achievement system<br>3. They're widely used and tested by the community<br>4. They don't impact save games or multiplayer<br><br>However, always download these mods from trusted sources and keep them updated with game patches."

Check crash logs for specific error messages<br>4. Look for common patterns (when/where crashes occur)<br>5. Verify mod load order is correct<br><br>Use mod managers' built-in tools to help identify conflicts and issues. Keep a log of which mods were active when crashes occurred."
        },
        "2": {
          "q": "Where can I find crash logs?",
          "a": "Crash logs can be found in several locations:<br><br>1. Main Location: 'Documents/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Crash Reports'<br>2.

        "1": {
          "q": "How many mods can I use at once?",

      "title": "Our Story",
      "content": "It all began during my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3. As a long-time RPG enthusiast, I was immediately captivated by the game's depth and possibilities. However, it was the modding community that truly opened my eyes to the game's incredible potential.\n\nLike many newcomers to BG3 modding, my journey started with a simple desire: I wanted to customize my character's appearance. What seemed like a straightforward task quickly turned into an adventure of its own. I spent hours browsing through hundreds of mods, reading compatibility notes, and trying to understand load orders. My first attempt at installing mods resulted in my character wearing a bucket for a head – not quite the heroic look I was aiming for!\n\nThe challenges didn't stop there. One memorable incident involved installing what I thought was a simple camp expansion mod. Instead, I accidentally installed a mod that turned all the camp's inhabitants into dancing goblins. While hilarious, it wasn't exactly conducive to the serious roleplaying experience I was seeking. Another time, I managed to install a mod that was supposed to enhance spell effects, only to find that every magic missile I cast turned into a shower of colorful rubber ducks.\n\nThese mishaps, while amusing, highlighted a serious issue: the BG3 modding scene, while incredibly rich and diverse, could be overwhelming for newcomers. I found myself maintaining spreadsheets to track mod compatibility, creating detailed installation guides for friends, and spending more time helping others troubleshoot their mod setups than actually playing the game.\n\nThat's when the idea struck me. What if there was a platform that could make the modding experience more accessible? A place where newcomers could easily find, understand, and install mods without going through the same trials and errors I did? A hub that could guide players through their modding journey, from their first character customization to advanced gameplay overhauls?\n\nThis website is the result of that vision. Built by a modding enthusiast for modding enthusiasts, it aims to bridge the gap between the amazing content created by our talented modding community and players who want to enhance their BG3 experience. Every feature, every category, and every guide on this site comes from real experiences – both the successes and the amusing failures.\n\nThe site's design reflects the lessons learned from countless hours of modding adventures. We've organized mods into intuitive categories, provided clear compatibility information, and created step-by-step installation guides. Our goal is to ensure that no new player has to accidentally turn their character into a tap-dancing goblin (unless, of course, that's what they're going for!).\n\nAs the BG3 modding community continues to grow and create incredible content, we're committed to evolving alongside it. This platform is more than just a mod database – it's a testament to the creativity, humor, and dedication of the modding community, and a helping hand to those just beginning their modding journey.\n\nSo whether you're looking to enhance your graphics, overhaul gameplay mechanics, or simply want to ensure your character's head stays firmly attached to their shoulders, we're here to help. Welcome to your friendly guide to the wonderful world of BG3 modding!"
