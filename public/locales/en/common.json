    "q1": {
      "question": "How do I install mods for Baldur's Gate 3?",
      "answer": "Most BG3 mods can be installed using mod managers like Vortex or BG3 Mod Manager. First, download the mod file, then use the manager to install and activate it. Some mods may require manual installation - always read the mod's documentation carefully."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Are mods compatible with multiplayer?",
      "answer": "Mod compatibility in multiplayer depends on several factors. Generally, all players need to have the same mods installed in the same order. UI and visual mods are usually safer for multiplayer than gameplay-changing mods."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Will mods disable achievements?",
      "answer": "By default, using mods will disable achievements in BG3. However, there are specific mods available that can re-enable achievements while using other mods."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What should I do if a mod causes crashes?",
      "answer": "First, verify the mod's compatibility with your game version. Try disabling the mod to confirm it's the source of the crash. Check for mod conflicts, and ensure you've installed all required dependencies. If issues persist, try reinstalling the mod."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Can I use multiple mods together?",
      "answer": "Yes, but you need to be careful about compatibility. Some mods may conflict with each other, especially if they modify the same game elements. Always check mod descriptions for compatibility information and load order requirements."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "How do I update my mods?",
      "answer": "Most mod managers will notify you of available updates. For manual installations, you'll need to check the mod's page regularly. Always backup your saves before updating mods, and read update notes for any special instructions."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Will mods affect my save games?",
      "answer": "Some mods can affect save games, especially those that modify gameplay mechanics or add new content. It's recommended to backup your saves before installing new mods. Removing mods mid-playthrough may corrupt save files."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What do I do if my game won't start after installing mods?",
      "answer": "Try verifying your game files through Steam/GOG, disable all mods and re-enable them one by one to identify the problematic mod. Check for mod conflicts and ensure you have all required dependencies installed."
